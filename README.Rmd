# BIO625HW3

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BIO625HW3 is to provide a simple linear regression function QY_lm for analyzing datasets.
This package implements a linear regression model (`QY_lm`) using ordinary least squares.
It provides detailed outputs such as coefficients, R-squared, residuals, and more.


## Installation

You can install the development version of BIO625HW3 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("RONNIEQING/BIO625HW3")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BIO625HW3)

# Load your dataset (assuming completedata.sas7bdat is available)
library(haven)
data <- read_sas("/Users/qingyu/Desktop/Umich/研一上/BIO650 Linear Reg/completedata.sas7bdat")

# Run the QY_lm function
result <- QY_lm(data, NIHScore ~ Age + Depression + Optimism)

# Print the regression results
print(result$coefficients)
print(result$R_squared)
print(result$adj_R_squared)

```
This example demonstrates how to load your data and run a simple regression analysis using QY_lm.


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 
With README.Rmd, you can include R code chunks that automatically run and generate output, such as this example:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
Using README.Rmd allows you to dynamically generate content, such as tables, plots, or results, ensuring your documentation is always up-to-date. To keep README.md consistent, simply re-render README.Rmd when needed.
