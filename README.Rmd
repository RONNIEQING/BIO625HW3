# BIO625HW3

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BIO625HW3 is to provide a simple linear regression function QY_lm for analyzing datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BIO625HW3 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("RONNIEQING/BIO625HW3")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BIO625HW3)

# Load your dataset (assuming completedata.sas7bdat is available)
library(haven)
data <- read_sas("/Users/qingyu/Desktop/Umich/研一上/BIO650 Linear Reg/completedata.sas7bdat")

# Run the QY_lm function
result <- QY_lm(data, NIHScore ~ Age + Depression + Optimism)

# Print the regression results
print(result$coefficients)
print(result$R_squared)
print(result$adj_R_squared)

```
This example demonstrates how to load your data and run a simple regression analysis using QY_lm.


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
